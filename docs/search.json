    "text": "Solution\nThe answer is actually Yes!\nLet \\(p\\) be any odd prime number. In this solution, we will denote\nas the remainder of n when divided by \\(p\\).\nWe now try to prove this lemma which kills the problem miraculously! ### Lemma\n\nGiven any odd prime number \\(p\\) we can get \\(p\\) positive integers that don’t exceed \\(2p^{2}\\) such that the pairwise sums of the integers are all different.\n\n\nProof of the lemma:\nLet \\(f(n) = 2pn + \\{ n^{2} \\}\\) for all \\(n = 0, \\ldots, p-1\\) .\nLet’s assume that \\(f(a) + f(b) = f(c) + f(d)\\); then we can easily notice that it implies \\(a + b = c + d\\) since \\(\\lfloor \\frac{f(a) + f(b)}{2p} \\rfloor = a + b\\), which also means that \\(\\{ a^{2} \\} + \\{ b^{2} \\} = \\{ c^{2} \\} + \\{ d^{2} \\}\\).\nNow we have the following conditions: \\(a + b \\equiv c + d \\pmod{p}\\) and \\(a^{2} + b^{2} \\equiv c^{2} + d^{2} \\pmod{p}\\), and the fact that \\(0 \\leq a,b,c,d \\leq p - 1\\) implies that the pairs \\(\\{ a,b \\}  and  \\{ c,d \\}\\) are actually the same. So that means if we have \\(\\{ a,b \\} \\neq \\{ c,d \\}\\), then we immediately have \\(f(a) + f(b) \\neq f(c) + f(d)\\), which finishes the proof of the lemma.\nNow all that remains is to plug \\(p = 101\\), and since we have \\(2 \\cdot (101)^{2} &lt; 25000\\), our problem is done \\(\\blacksquare\\)."
